<h1>procedurally generated level tree</h1> </br>
you can only access levels that you have taken over. To take over a level you need to attack it and in order to do that you need to be on a level thats connected to the level you want to attack. </br>
Attack - just takes over a level </br>
Go - Changes currentLevel to selected one if accesible </br>
Gold level = CurrentLevel </br>
Blue level = Level is taken over and can be set as currentLevel </br>
White level = selectedLevel </br>
